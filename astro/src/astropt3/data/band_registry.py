"""Physical per-band constants and normalization for the image modality.

Ported from galactiktok (branch ``feat/norm``,
``models/image_transformer/band_registry.py`` + the tokenizer's
``_normalize``/``_physical_factors``/``decode`` methods). Source of truth for
the constants is the **surveys' own documentation**, not any external model.
Each band carries a magnitude zeropoint, pixel scale, and a bright-star
magnitude ``m_bright``; the pipeline uses these to rescale raw survey flux to
a common LegacySurvey nanomaggies scale and to clamp survey-flagged bright
pixels.

Everything is keyed to LegacySurvey: nanomaggies with AB zeropoint 22.5 and
0.262 arcsec/pixel (``m_AB = 22.5 - 2.5*log10(flux_nmgy)``).

Records with bands that are all in :data:`RAW_BANDS` pass through untouched;
records mixing RAW and registry bands raise (not a real case for us — records
are all-``des-*`` or all-``rgb-*``).

Constants and citations
------------------------
DES / LegacySurvey (``des-g/r/i/z``)
    zeropoint 22.5, pixel scale 0.262 arcsec/pix (reference scale, identity
    rescale). ``m_bright = 16.0`` from the LegacySurvey ``MEDIUM`` bright-star
    mask (Gaia DR2 ``phot_g_mean_mag < 16``), the full extent of masked stars.
    https://www.legacysurvey.org/dr9/external/ (BRIGHT = G<13, MEDIUM = G<16).

HSC PDR3 (``hsc-g/r/i/z/y``)
    zeropoint 27.0, pixel scale 0.168 arcsec/pix (hsc-release coadd docs).
    ``m_bright = 18.0`` all bands: PDR3 defines the mask "for stars brighter
    than 18mag in each HSC broad-band filter".
    https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/index.php/bright-star-masks__pdr3/

JWST NIRCam, GOODS-South (``jwst-f090w`` ... ``jwst-f444w``)
    zeropoint 28.9. Pixel scale 0.02 (short-wave f090..f200) / 0.04 (long-wave
    f277..f444) arcsec/pix per the ADR.  ``m_bright`` is the NIRCam full-frame
    saturation magnitude (K-mag Vega, G2V star, ~80% full well) per filter,
    from the NIRCam sensitivity/saturation tables.
    http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/nircam/in_sensitivity.php
    GOODS-South is a deep field with no bright stars, so this clamp is a safety
    ceiling that effectively never fires. Two accepted approximations: the
    quoted magnitude is K-mag Vega of a G2V star (not in-filter AB), and the
    0.02/0.04 pixel scales are the ADR values — verify against the parquet
    ``image.scale`` field, since the 7 bands share one 96x96 grid and so may
    share a single common pixel scale.
